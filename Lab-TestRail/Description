TestRail Test Suite
Create a Section under any of our 3 Projects you wish, using the following naming scheme: LastName-FirstName_SectionName. LastName should be your last name as it appears in Catalyst; the same is true for FirstName. You can choose any string you want for SectionName.

Populate your Section with at least six test cases, each of which includes Steps and Expected Result. You may create sub-sections if you think they are needed for better organization.

Then create a Test Run for all of your test cases, using the following naming scheme: LastName-FirstName_SectionName-Run. Execute each test case in the run, and add Bugzilla bug ids to those that fail.

To hand in your assignment, send me pieces of info via Catalyst:

Your test Section name.
The URL of your test run
