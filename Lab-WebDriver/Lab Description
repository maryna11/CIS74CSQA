Lab Exercise: Modifying a Selenium/WebDriver/Pytest Test Case
In this exercise, you will be exposed to Selenium/WebDriver with Python test case automation via a simple modification of a test case written by me. Your main challenge will probably be installation of all the components needed to run my test!

Install Python, pytest, and the Selenium/WebDriver Python bindings on your computer.
Run my test--A-links.py. Do not proceed to the next step until you have my test case working!
Modify my test to work for the 8 links you were assigned for our 05/02 in-class exercise.
To submit this lab exercise, upload your single .py file containing the test case.
